Hungarian Central Bank (MNB - Magyar Nemzeti Bank) Exchange Rate SOAP servive


The Hungarian Central Bank is providing a service to get the latest Exchange Rates for the available currencies

This small service file in python, help to get the latest exchange rate for a given currency. 
The MNB class is in mnb.py file, just initialize the class and call the method.


There is a thin Django based test file to help to use the class if you need some help.


It is not a full solution, the file doesn't contain every available service (like get the exchange rate for a given day, you can only get the latest)

The official documentation of the service (in Hungarian language):
