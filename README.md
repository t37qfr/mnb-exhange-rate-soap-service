This small service allowe to get the latest exchange rate for a given currency. The MNB class is in mnb.py file


There is a thin Django based test file to help to use the service if you need some help.


It is not a full solution, the file doesn't contian every avaible service (like get the exchange rate for a given day, you can only get the latest)
